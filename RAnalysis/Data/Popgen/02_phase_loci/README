# In R I used the script 02_phase_loci in my github repo to produce the vcf.gz files for each pop
# 'pop' is by univariable Generation_Type_Treatment as F0-F3, broodstock or juveniles, and Low Moderate or High OA 
# imported the vcf.gz files by 'pop' into sedna using scp
ls *.gz > infile
sed 's/\..*$//g' infile > infile2 # omit .vcf.gz
mv infile2 infil # rename

# run for loop iterating eachline to phase with beagle and bcftools
module load bio/beagle/5.2

# loop throguh infile and phase using beagle
cat infile | while read i; do java -Xmx2g -jar /opt/bioinformatics/bio/beagle/beagle-5.2/beagle.28Jun21.220.jar gt=$i.vcf.gz out=$i.phased; done
