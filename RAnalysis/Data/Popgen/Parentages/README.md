**About**

* *excel_workbooks*

    - downloaded directly from the goolge drive for the bay scallop project

    - contexts as F1, F2, and F2 Parentages

    - what do we mean by *parentage* in these document titles? Contents contain the broodstock adult scallop ids
    sorted by fertilization batches and whether sperm (male) or egg (female) gametes were used for that batch. *Parentage*
    refers the  parents for the offspring  generation in the title. n other words,  F1 and F3 Parentages are the parent broodstock
    F0 and F2 scallops whose gametes were fertilized to produce F1 and F3 offspring.

    - **Note**: in no case were both serm and egg used for the same fertilization batch, this was critical to avoid self fertilization!



* *formatted*

  - the raw excel sheets were reformatted for ease of access to all data needed to reun parentage anlysis (i.e. using sequoia in R)

  - files F1_Parentage, F2_Parentage, F3_Parentage
